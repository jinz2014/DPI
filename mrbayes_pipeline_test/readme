Note

Using SV DPI to compare the hw pipeline outputs with those of the sw model

Both the hw and sw models are driven by the input data from the test data file. 

The number of queues is equal to the number of output ports. All the queues have the 
same input data pushed when pipeline enable(en) is high. Data from a queue is popped out
when the corresponding output result is valid in the hw model.
